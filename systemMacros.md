+ `$_date$` - Prints the current date, ex `December 22, 2013`
+ `$_month$`
+ `$_comment$` - Ignores whatever is passed as an argument, so the argument only shows up in the source.
+ `$_import$` - Takes one argument, a file to load, processes it and places it at the current location
+ `$_importRaw$` - Does the same as `_import` but doesn't process the file (useful for importing css sheets or something like that) 
+ `$_if$` - Takes 3 arguments, if the first is equal to true (case insensitive) then the first argument is outputted, otherwise the second one is outputted.
+ `$_equal$` - Takes 2 arguments, if they are equal, then it returns `true`
+ `$_length$` - Takes 1 argument, and returns the length of it (whether it's a list or just text)
+ `$_elementAt$`- Takes 2 arguments, the first is a list, and the second is an index. It returns
